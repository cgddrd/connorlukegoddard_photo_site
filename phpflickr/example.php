 * This example file shows you how to call the 100 most recent public
 * photos.  It parses through them and prints out a link to each of them
 * along with the owner's name.
 *
 * Most of the processing time in this file comes from the 100 calls to
 * flickr.people.getInfo.  Enabling caching will help a whole lot with
 * this as there are many people who post multiple photos at once.
 *
 * Obviously, you'll want to replace the "<api key>" with one provided 
 * by Flickr: http://www.flickr.com/services/api/key.gne
